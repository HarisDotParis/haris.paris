Hello and welcome on my website! As I have many projects and do lots of different stuff – IT, tech, amateur radio, linguistics and politics – I want to bundle my experiences here and share them with you. While my website will focus on my career, the blog will be rather diverse and have the "big picture" in mind, being less about singular topics but more about fascinating and entertaining topics. So stay curious about what I have to share here in the future – you will get to find out lots of new insights and innovations as well as my thoughts about the current state of affairs. See you again here very soon!
